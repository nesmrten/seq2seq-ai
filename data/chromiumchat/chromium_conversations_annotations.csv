eric pointed out some confusion: We should not be tracking CKF flags on the NSS side - or at least, generating the keys with all flags.

In the end, it won't matter - the Blink side is responsible for enforcing usages.

The example of why we shouldn't be doing this is a key being used to unwrap JWKs. NSS will never support JWK, so it will need to CKF_DECRYPT the JWK and then import that, but if this is used, it'll only have the CKF_UNWRAP.

If it won't let you supply no usages, supply all usages (that are valid for that key type) - eg: no sign/verify for AES keys.",5.06451612903226,1.13157894736842,0.387596899224806,1.22,1,0,0,1,0.378503146985571,0.485239832436495,0.00945236775317815,0.455954147141302,129,5,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,"acted-upon"

Some questions...

* Does/should this file be visible in the downloads tray?

* Should this file be automagically deleted at some point or should it remain in the users Downloads folder?

Depending on the answers, things would probably be different in how to handle it. I think these answers to those questions, YES and NO, make for the simplest implementation with regard to blob handling. In particular the answer to the second question (dont automagically delete) makes the real difference.

Assuming for the moment we don't automagically delete these files...

I think you just want to send the full file path (not a blob url) to the WebIntentHost running in the recipient renderer process. And to use the WebBlob::createFromFile(full_file_path, file_size) method to create the blob, that method expects a FilePath as input. And that's it... no need to muck with blob storage controller and such.

IOW doing last_(0) would be no less correct, but less confusing.

However, using last_(0) has the down-side of the unobvious fact that the first run through WaitMultiple will populate [1,size) followed by 0.
If instead of tracking last_ you tracked next_start_offset_ then you could drop the -1 here (by  initializing to 0 here), and have a more expected order in the first run of WaitMultiple (and subsequent runs stay as obvious).  Plus, IMO, the calc of

EnableAutoresize allows dynamic sizing to fit the HTML content. Whenever the content bounds want to change, the delegates ResizeDueToAutoresize is invoked.

AFAIK, blink doesn't directly have a concept of a preferred size for content - if autoresize is off, it'll size to whatever the container size is. Maybe there's a way to reach into its innards and query a preferred size, but I'm not aware of one. (That'd also still require you to have a callback whenever the layout changes)

It depends. If it's a bug in VM we should crash at assertion in debug mode, or crash later in release mode. We should not try to add protection against all possible Dart VM bugs, because it's simply impossible and we already use asserts in most cases. Why this case is different? If it's a bug in bindings, we should fix it :)

Crash makes it even more obvious. Could we add more tests instead of changing APIs to help us catch the bugs?

Could you please clarify? Internal error from SerializedScriptValue's parameter adapter will be processed the same way as DOM exceptions.

Yes, but not out-of-the-box, and we can refine that later. LocalStyleChange should work iff:

1. The new flag in RareInheritedData triggers Inherit from LayoutStyle::stylePropagationDiff when it changes.
2. A change in the flag, inherited from any ancestor or set from the element itself, is the only thing that needs to trigger a recalculation.

Anyway, we should keep this out of scope for this CL.

I disagree. Data races are never a good excuse for any design. Sorry.

Frankly speaking, I have done some designs where data races were ""benign"", i.e. in worst case produced only some incorrectly gathered statistics, and even this sometimes wakes me up as a nightmare. Here we make eviction decisions based on this data, which makes the matter very complex and hardly reproducible if a data race resulted in a very unusual code path.

Also, data races will be reported by data race detection tools, which we would need to suppress using annotations in our code, which is very complicated and requires a lot of expertise.

In the end, manual data privatization to threads is a commonly used pattern for optimization. We may incapsulate it into a single class that would be easier to update. Occasional inconsistencies when updating code may happen, of course, but at least it would be buried within the same small class.",3.625,1.16666666666667,0.428949107732981,1.64406779661017,0.910112359550562,0.117977528089888,0.0730337078651685,0.98314606741573,0.397363330231138,0.601759440912119,0.00511441807757562,0.999904169458375,178,10,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,"not (known to be) acted-upon"

What was the DCHECK failure exactly?

It should be safe to pass WeakPtrs between threads, as long as it's only used/invalidated on the originating thread. (So it'd be problematic if the runner's thread isn't the same as the destruction thread, but that's inherently racy.)

Reading though socket_permission.h/cc, the code looks very similar. If this is going to be a more common pattern, we may want to have a look at defining a new class like CompositeAPIPermission rather than duplicating 100s of lines of code each time.

I haven't looked into how to implement this too much. The socket permissions have this SocketPermissionData thing, since apparently parsing socket permissions is complicated.

- Make PrecacheFetcher always take in an UnfinishedWork and develop its state around that, where UnfinishedWork could represent the state before precaching was even started.

(There is also a non_localized_name() method that I think returns the content of the raw name key in the manifest which may or may not need localization substitions). 

Also, note that the extension's name can change over time due to autoupdate (this happens somewhat frequently) or the user changing their locale (probably happens less frequently). Not sure if that's a UI problem or not here - I guess in most cases you're always fetching the current data and not caching? It might be worth a comment in the .idl file on the field warning developers that while the id value will remain static, the name value could change.

Maybe we can add the following point (with better wording :-):

- You should use a WeakMember only when you really need weak semantics. In other words, if A has a pointer to B and A can outlive B, you should use a WeakMember for the pointer. Otherwise (i.e., A and B dies at the same time or B outlives A), you should use a Member.

In general, I think we really want to...

1) be designing our classes to use the underlying Mojo services for things like files and network access.
2) Design all of our I/O classes with an async IO model in mind, not a synchronous one.

There are multiple ways to fake out ffmpeg's transport interfaces if we go this route.  The simplest way would be to use a mojo service to get a data pipe and then just use the data pipe in a synchronous.

1) the fault is related to the commit, and we need to move the commit aside rather than retry it, so that we don't keep repeating the same error.

2) the fault is infrastructure-related, rather than patch related, and we should (a) retry the commit, and (b) consider not doing anything else until the error resolves itself (i.e., pressing on will just create more failed commits).

Of course, we can also take the approach that failures are rare enough than any failure should be removed and we can happily pretend as if we never saw it. This seems to be the approach you're taking here. This may be good enough, but I'd like to see more commenting about how exactly this is safe to swallow/ignore.

1) Whether we have a valid player, currently determined by mPlayerId == INVALID_PLAYER_ID. Currently this maps to onRequest/onRelease, with the snag that onRequest can be called twice with different IDs.

2) Whether we have a surface view, ie mSurfaceView == null.

3) Whether mSurfaceView is added as child of container view. Currently, this is the same as 2)

4) Whether surface is attached to the media player, ie attach/detachExternalVideoSurface. Nothing explicitly tracks this, so I think right now it might be possible to say call detachExternalVideoSurface twice on the same player id.

A few proposals for you to consider:

a) Split apart 2 and 3, and merge 3 and 4, ie add/remove surface view as child at the same time that the surface is attached/detached from the video player. And also explicitly track this state to avoid repeated calls.

b) Merge 1) and 2). When onRequest is called when mPlayerId is valid, go through all the motions of tearing down the current player, ie detach surface player and remove child, then set mPlayerId to invalid, and release the surface view. Then start from scratch again for the new player.

Then the state machine looks something like:

The way we use it is totally different from a DemuxerStream, so it doesn't pass the ""UrlDemuxerStream is a DemuxerStream"" test. The ""NOTREACHED"" in the .cc file demonstrated this as well.

Conceptually, the UrlDemuxerStreamProvider doesn't even need to be a Demuxer either. For example, Seek() on UrlDemuxerStreamProvider doesn't make sense. But I see that currently WMPI and Pipeline* is deeply integrated with Demuxer. Changing that would require a much larger refactoring. So I think UrlDemuxerStreamProvider is fine for now. In the future we can iterate on this.

With that, I wonder whether we can:

1, In DemuxerStreamProvider, in addition to GetStream(), add another method like GetUrl(). The contract will be something like a DemuxerStreamProvider should return non-null for GetStream() (audio and/or video), or non-empty URL for GetUrl(), but not both.

2. Since UrlDemuxerStreamProvider is a Demuxer which is a DemuxerStreamProvider, this should be sufficient for the Renderer to retrieve the URL.

I suspected something like that. However, the previous code _was_ using WaitForSingleProcess, and I don't see any waitpid calls after WaitForChildTermination. That suggests that WaitForChildTermination is a part of the test.

Which is weird, because it's an extremely bad way to wait for child termination.

It looks like a regression in test to me, i.e. the test was good (WaitForSingleProcess), and now it's less reliable.

If you really need it, could you instead of changing existing tests, copy them and use WaitForChildTermination in the copy?",3.68181818181818,1.25,0.417832167832168,1.30769230769231,0.5,0,0.144230769230769,0.644230769230769,0.271264610905669,0.6290591786193,0.0040376857796327,0.983258688681398,104,7,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,"not (known to be) acted-upon"

Also, see my comment earlier about problem in proxy_service.cc because it is also using this method.

I think the best thing to do is to split the current MapSchemeToProxy() into two methods, to reflect the two desired behaviors.

// (1)
public:
  const ProxyServer* MapUrlSchemeToProxy()
// Returns &proxy_for_socks instead of NULL in cases where 
// proxy_for_socks.is_valid() -- i.e. fallback to SOCKS if there
// is nothing more specific.

// (2)
private:
 const ProxyServer* MapUrlSchemeToProxy()
// Internal method used by ParseFromString(). basically the same
// as the current version; |if (scheme == ""socks"")| returns
// &proxy_for_socks.

We block prerendering for anything but search-type matches associated with the default search provider.

This is more restrictive than necessary.  All that's really needed to be able to successfully prerender is that the |destination_url| of |match| be from the same origin and path as the default search engine, and the params to be sent to the server be a subset of the params we can pass to the prerenderer.  So for example, if we normally prerender search URLs like https://google.com/search?q=foo&x=bar, then any match with a URL like that, potentially with the q and/or x params omitted, is prerenderable.

However, if the URL has other params _not_ normally in the prerendered URL, there's no way to pass them to the prerendered page, and worse, if the URL does something like specifying params in both the query and ref sections of the URL (as Google URLs often do), it can quickly become impossible to figure out how to correctly tease out the right param names and values to send.  Rather than try and write parsing code to deal with all these kinds of cases, for various different search engines, including accommodating changing behavior over time, we do the simple restriction described above.

Aye, I was thinking ""unsigned"" the compiler was allowed for integer promotion (much in the way it does for enums). However, C++03 7.1.5.2.1 covers that ""unsigned"" == ""unsigned int"".

So are you saying that you will poll for hasCompleted? It does not sound right. Remote debugging protocol has notifications for that. So, for example, if you want to send entire trace after every ""Tracing.end"" call, you simply send a notification (like https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/protocol/1.0/dom#event-childNodeInserted) from within OnEndTracingComplete (what thread is it called on btw?).

Notifications are simply commands with no requestIds. Unfortunately, it will require you to push server sink into the handler. That sink would need to check for connection being asynchronously closed / server shut down.

Now I remember you had something like that and I made you remove it. I did not pay attention to the fact that you already need notifications and now I feel sorry. So I am suggesting that I do it for you in a subsequent patch in order to not put much stress on you.

This test imports dart:io.  This means that it can only work on the VM.

When this test is being run on dart2js, it only tests that dart2js can generate code.  But the code dart2js generates is a no-op.  This is because dart2js (during testing) is run with the option --enable-mock-compilation.

Lets assume you have two extensions, A and B, that have two wildly differing feature sets. A does a FindInPage replacement, the other replaces all images on the page with cat images. It doesn't make sense to bind the same shortcut (say Ctrl+F) to both of those features because you'd want them mutually exclusive -- It would be weird for all the images to turn to cats *and* the Find box to open at the same time. 

For MediaKeys that's a different story because they have special predefined system functions that are of interest to many extensions. You might have more than one recipient who wants to listen for say VolumeUp (Example: a music app and a video player, to name two).
